# MUST
- improved logging 
    - remove send_info, send_error, send_warning and use logging for that
    - improve logging control
- Exploration techniques
- Python negation (not) in if statements
- stack visualisation
- evaluate multiple solutions
- prity print of constraints/(BV)
- history output length (limited -> slows down)
- command history to file (fish-like shell)
- check completion

# Breaking bugs
- break_addr --> result = BREAK

# WANT
- support cfg for range
- syntax highlighting (grammar -> lexer see https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/asking_for_input.html)
- edit written functions
- Vi style edit on functions
- Less with command from history arg
- Enter repeats the previous command (handy for step)
- Autocomplete on files for load
- list_binary_symbols filter on functions
- indicator that run is really running
- a way to step trough execution like a while loop (for example using input in python)

# CTF
add more ctf examples of [angr examples](https://docs.angr.io/en/latest/examples.html) and [angr ctf examples](https://docs.angr.io/en/latest/appendix/more-examples.html)

cleanup markdown files / copy info from original

# Installation
- Install issue ??, fix docker

# Unit testing
- add more tests

# Doucmentation
- improve documentation
- Angr examples

# Parsing
- cleaner feedback on invalid tokens/parsing?

# FUTURE WORK
# Debugging - async
- pause does not work as you cannot give inputs while running ...
