ar# Example 08_angr_constraints
## Context

## Script

1. Load the file and initialize memory with zero
```
load '08_angr_constraints'
unconstrained_fill
```
2. Since scanf is not supported, we start the execution after the scanf call, create 3 symex symbols and assign the symbols to the registers containing the scanf result.
```
add_symbol password 16

set_entry_state 0x804863c

set_memory 0x804a040 &sym.password

```
3. Add an address filter to break on 'Good Job' and exclude states that output 'Try again'
```
breakpoint (by_address 0x8048683)
run
```

4. Obtain the results
```
add_constraint &mem[0x804a040->16] == b'OSIWHBXIFOQVSBZB'

to_str (evaluate &sym.password bytes)

```
