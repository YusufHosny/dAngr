ar# Example 08_angr_constraints
## Context

## Script

1. Load the file and initialize memory with zero
```
load '13_angr_static_binary'
unconstrained_fill True
```
2. Since scanf is not supported, we start the execution after the scanf call, create 3 symex symbols and assign the symbols to the registers containing the scanf result.
```
hook_function "libc.printf" 0x804fab0
hook_function "libc.scanf" 0x804fb10
hook_function "libc.puts" 0x80503f0
hook_function "glibc.__libc_start_main" 0x8048d60

```
3. Add an address filter to break on 'Good Job' and exclude states that output 'Try again'
```
breakpoint (by_stream "Good Job")
exclude (by_stream "Try again")
run
```

4. Obtain the results
```
dump_stdstream stdin
```
