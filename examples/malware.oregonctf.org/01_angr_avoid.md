# Example 01_angr_void
## Context
Explore the binary, but this time, instead of only looking for a state that reaches the print_good_address, also find a state that does not reach  will_not_succeed_address. The binary is pretty large, to save you some time, everything you will need to look at is near the beginning of the address space.


## Script

1. Load the file:

`load '01_angr_avoid'`

2. Search for the string 'Good Job' in the binaries string symbols and notice its address *at 0x80d463e*

`list_binary_strings`

3. Search for the use of the string address and search for the 'avoid_me' function.
```
get_basicblocks
less
```
4. Add an address filter to break on the code using the string 'Good Job', and an address filter to exclude the 'avoid_me' function, and execute the binary
```
breakpoint (by_address 0x80485f7)
exclude (by_address 0x80485bf)
run
```
5. Finally, Retrieve the result

`dump_stdstream stdin`
