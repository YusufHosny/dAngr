# Example 11_angr_sim_scanf
## Context

## Script

1. Load the file and initialize memory with zero
```
load '11_angr_sim_scanf'
unconstrained_fill True
```
2. Since scanf is not supported, we start the execution after the scanf call, create 3 symex symbols and assign the symbols to the registers containing the scanf result.
```

def scanf(format_string, address0, address1):
    add_symbol scanf0 4
    add_symbol scanf1 4
    set_memory address0 &sym.scanf0 endness=MEMORY
    set_memory address1 &sym.scanf1 endness=MEMORY
    add_to_state solution0 &sym.scanf0
    add_to_state solution1 &sym.scanf1

hook_function  "scanf" "__isoc99_scanf" 

```
3. Add an address filter to break on 'Good Job' and exclude states that output 'Try again'
```
breakpoint (by_stream "Good Job")
exclude (by_stream "Try again")
run
```

4. Obtain the results
```
sol0 = get_from_state solution0
sol1 = get_from_state solution1
s0 = to_int (evaluate sol0)
s1 = to_int (evaluate sol1)
!("{} {}".format(&vars.s0,&vars.s1))
```
